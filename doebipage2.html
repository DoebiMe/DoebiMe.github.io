          Hi, my name is Danny Doubbel.
          I was born january 29th 1973. Married, with children.
          <br />
          Yes, I'm getting old.
          <br />
          I love all about electronincs , mechanincs , automation , programming.
          <br />
          Since my teenage youth I started to program on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64"> Commodore 64 </a>.
          <br />
          First I did basic , later on I explored the wonderfull world of assembler.
          <br />
          When I got my first real pc (80286) at age of 15 , I moved on to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic"> qbasic</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal"> Pascal</a>, C.
          <br />
          Later on I came across C++, Visual Basic for DOS and Windows.
          <br />
          Meanwhile, all those time I worked in electrical industrial enviroments, making and fixing
          <br />
          machines, programmed PLC's and microcontrollers and did draw the shematics.
          <br />
          Despite my big interests , programming was almost exclusive for machines, rest was hobby.
          <br />
          Now, since last 2 year, I started long cources, 2 evenings a week to feed my
          <br />
          hunger for knowlage in PHP, javascript on thurstday, C# on friday in <a href="https://www.deavondschool.be/">
            CVO De Avondschool at Ostend</a>
          <br />
          And now, I want to master Java and make it a full time job.
